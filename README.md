# Swoogo Technical Challenge

I was trying to be clever and show off and ended up wasting a bunch of time. As such, this ended up being much more rushed than I would have liked. It's a bit messy in places and some things are lacking documentation.

NOTE: You will need to add the consumer key & secret, and the event ID to the config.json file to run the code.
